### My Process

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm really oppurtuned to know a lots of new html and css properties during my period writing this project, and i hope to be best at it. I was able to know more flexbox properties whereas some sematics on html also for example:

html
<section>Some HTML code I'm proud of</section>


css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}


### Continued development

i want to focus more on media query, css grid, positioning and css animations, moreso get prepared for what coming next.
